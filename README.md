# hello-world
My first repository

I am an accountant and I want to learn coding.  Right now I am taking
a class on full-stack web design through Udemy and the App Brewery so
far it is going well.  I figure with not bein able to work due to the 
COVID-19 epedimic, it would be a great time to lean a new skill, so 
here I am learning web design.  Hope to meet a lot of really cool
people.
